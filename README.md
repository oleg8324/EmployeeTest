# EmployeeTest
In order to run, use .net Core 6 and visual studio to run.
Completed using most raw C# classes like factories and singleton, in order to use less framework specific stuff like session management, because in different versions of .net sessions management can be different, if I would have chosen to save employees in session variables..
