# EmployeeTest
In order to run, use .net Core 6 and visual studio to run.
Completed using most raw C# classes like factories and singleton, in order to use less framework specific stuff like session management, and for simplification,  because in different types of WebApps sessions management can be somewhat different, if I would have chosen to save employees in session variables..
